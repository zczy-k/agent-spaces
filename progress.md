# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-05-03

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
- **Status:** complete
- **Started:** 2026-05-03 14:15 CST
- Actions taken:
  - Read AI message rendering documentation.
  - Read chat message rendering, queue, chain-of-thought, shared message types, chat panel, and server websocket handler.
  - Confirmed queue usage is isolated to the `todo` branch in `message-parts.tsx`.
  - Identified completion rebuild in `handler.ts` as the likely duplicate final message source.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`

### Phase 2: Technical Approach
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Chose to keep the `todo` message part schema and swap only the frontend component mapping.
  - Chose to render reasoning and tools through `ChainOfThought` so intermediate AI output and tool usage appear as chain content.
  - Chose to build final parts from live stream output when available.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Replaced queue-based `todo` rendering with `ChainOfThought` primitives.
  - Rendered reasoning/intermediate AI output with `ChainOfThought`.
  - Updated server completion path to use `liveOutput` as final display output when available.
  - Updated AI message rendering documentation.
- Files created/modified:
  - `packages/web/src/components/chat/message-parts.tsx`
  - `packages/server/src/ws/handler.ts`
  - `docs/ai-message-rendering.md`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`

### Phase 6: Concise Chain Tool UI
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Started discovery for editor file-opening flow and lazy tool detail API.
  - Extended message todo items with optional tool metadata (`toolName`, `filePath`, `command`, `detailId`).
  - Added structured Claude tool-use events so full tool input can be stored outside streamed message parts.
  - Added `tool-detail` persistence and a channel route for lazy detail lookup.
  - Changed tool chain UI to show compact summaries, file open buttons, and a lazy details drawer.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `packages/shared/src/types/channel.ts`
  - `packages/server/src/adapters/agent-runtime-types.ts`
  - `packages/server/src/adapters/claude-code-runtime.ts`
  - `packages/server/src/services/tool-detail.ts`
  - `packages/server/src/routes/channel.ts`
  - `packages/server/src/ws/handler.ts`
  - `packages/web/src/components/chat/message-item.tsx`
  - `packages/web/src/components/chat/message-parts.tsx`

### Phase 7: Verification
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Ran shared and server builds.
  - Ran targeted lint on touched chat components.
- Files created/modified:
  - `progress.md`

### Phase 8: Tool Detail Output
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Confirmed Claude runtime logs `tool_use_result` from user messages but does not currently emit it to websocket handler.
  - Added `tool_result` runtime events using `parent_tool_use_id`.
  - Persisted tool result output on the matching tool detail record.
  - Updated lazy detail formatting to show both Input and Output sections.
  - Re-ran shared/server builds and targeted chat lint.
- Files created/modified:
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `progress.md`
  - `packages/server/src/adapters/agent-runtime-types.ts`
  - `packages/server/src/adapters/claude-code-runtime.ts`
  - `packages/server/src/services/tool-detail.ts`
  - `packages/server/src/ws/handler.ts`
  - `packages/web/src/components/chat/message-parts.tsx`

### Phase 9: Monaco Detail Viewer
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Added a read-only Monaco-based `ReadonlyCodeBlock` for tool detail sections.
  - Replaced plain text detail rendering with structured Input/Output viewers.
  - Added Edit/MultiEdit detail rendering through `DiffViewer`.
  - Edit diff uses `old_string/new_string` or `edits[]`; when tool output includes full file content, that content is used as the modified side.
  - Re-ran targeted frontend lint and shared/server builds.
- Files created/modified:
  - `packages/web/src/components/chat/readonly-code-block.tsx`
  - `packages/web/src/components/chat/message-parts.tsx`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `progress.md`

### Phase 10: Repeated Edit Detail Matching
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Confirmed repeated Edit calls can produce identical compact tool lines while their saved tool detail records remain unique.
  - Fixed chain item detail lookup to consume matching details by raw-line occurrence order during each message build.
  - Documented the distinction between `tool_result` output association and chain item `detailId` backfill.
  - Ran server build.
- Files created/modified:
  - `packages/server/src/ws/handler.ts`
  - `docs/ai-message-rendering.md`
  - `task_plan.md`
  - `findings.md`
  - `progress.md`

## Error Log
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-05-03 14:20 CST | Full web lint fails on unrelated existing files | 1 | Ran targeted lint on touched chat files, which passed. |
| 2026-05-03 14:21 CST | Web typecheck exposed `chain-of-thought.tsx` dependency on missing `@radix-ui/react-use-controllable-state` | 1 | Replaced with local React controlled/uncontrolled state logic. |

| 2026-05-03 14:45 CST | Server build failed because `workspace` was scoped inside `try` and shared dist had old `MessageTodo` type | 1 | Moved `workspace` outside `try`, rebuilt shared before server. |
